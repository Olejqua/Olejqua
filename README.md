### 👋 Hey! I'm Oleg

I'm a **Frontend Lead & Indie Hacker** — mostly working with React, Next.js, TypeScript, and building MVPs that (hopefully) people want to use.

- 🚀 Currently building and breaking things in startups.
- ⚡️ Love clean UI, pragmatic code, and the occasional "rewrite everything" moment.
- 🧑‍💻 8+ years shipping stuff to production.
- 🧩 Pet projects keep me sane. Check my repos — you might find something weirdly useful.
- ☕️ Always up for coffee & tech rants.

### 🛠️ Tech playground

`React · Next.js · TypeScript · Zustand · shadcn/ui · Tailwind CSS · React Query · Hono · Bun · Supabase · PostgreSQL · Docker · CI/CD`

### 📬 How to reach me

Feel free to open an issue, drop a PR or ping me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olejqua/) — or just watch me build yet another todo app.
